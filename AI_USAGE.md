# AI Usage Document

This project was scaffolded with the help of an AI assistant (ChatGPT - GPT-5 Thinking mini).
The assistant created the project skeleton, Kotlin source files, gradle files, README and tests.

Use of AI:
- Generated initial project structure and code for WebSocket connection, basic parsing, repository, ViewModel, and Compose UI.
- Recommended improvements (not implemented): robust reconnection strategies, exponential backoff, DI, more unit tests, UI polish.

Human review required for production readiness. All generated code should be inspected, refactored, and tested before submission.
